# Writing simulation and analysis tools using F# and Z3

## Introduction

This practical is intended as a brief introduction to the F# programming language and the SMT solver Z3. In the course of this practical you will be performing two types of biological simulation; you will be writing a small Gillespie simulator for the single progenitor model of epithelial stem cells, and editing and exploring logical models of small biological networks. This practical builds on the discussions of F# and Z3 in lecture 4, and the demonstrations in the associated supervision. The goal of this practical is to allow you to see how you model different systems using a functional programming language (F#) and formal logic (using Z3). The final questions in each section are more open ended so aim to spend about 1.5 hours on each component.

## Getting started

I recommend looking at 

https://notebooks.azure.com/Microsoft/libraries/samples/html/FSharp%20for%20Azure%20Notebooks.ipynb

as a reference for using F# in jupyter notebooks.

## Z3 for logical models

Reread "Simple Z3 example" and "Timing Z3 example", before working on to "NegativeFeedbackLoops"

## F# for stochastic simulation

Complete the code in the Single Progenitor notebook, following the instructions
